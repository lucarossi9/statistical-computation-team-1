### Assignments

#### Federica

Questions:
- Which are the correlations between the study time and the grade ?
- Which are the correlations between the study time and the grade ?
- Are there any extreme values in the grades?
- Visualization to better understand different aspects of the dataset

Techniques: Descriptive statistics

#### Francesco

Questions:
- Do the grades follow a normal distribution ?
- Are there significant differences between boys and girls?
- Effects of Parents Status

Techniques: Hypothesis testing

#### Pau

Questions:
- Which is the capacity of different variables to explain the grades ?
- Variable importance
- Confidence intervals of the grade distribution

Techniques: Linear and Generalized linear models

#### Mattia & Luca

Questions:
- Can we train a model to predict grade based on the other variables ?
- Do the same for other variables (predict parents education based on grades & study time for example)

Techniques: Machine learning methodologies

Luca will try with neural nets

(The focus of Mattia & Luca is on prediction while Pau will focus more on explainability)
