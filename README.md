# Brief description of the problem

We would like to analyse a dataset about student performances at school. The dataset contains information about different factors which may be connected to their performance such as their families educations, how they spend their free time, the reason why they chose the school,...
We would like to analise how these factors affect the performance and how they are linked to each other, so the main questions we want to address are:
1) Using a regression model we look for the factors which affect the performance the most (using correlation for example) in order to understand for example if having a lot of free time helps them having better grades or if their romantic situation do it.
2) We would like to analyse the correlation between the factors such as the education of their parents and their job or the correlation between the alchool consumption and the parents background.
